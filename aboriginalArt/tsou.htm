There are taboos prohibiting the women to set foot 
into the "Kuba" (the assembly halls). Among the tribal 
rituals, the Victory Ritual that is generally called 
"Mayasvi" is the most important one, the renovation of 
"Kuba". Teenagers must stay and live in this hall and 
are trained before they are married. 

The cutting of the holy tree, or for inviting, 
entertaining, and sending off the holy spirits, 
is famous for the complicated process. The staged 
and chemical collaboration of songs and dances are 
especially worthy of further study.

Victory Festival: During the rule of emperor Kangxi in the Ching Dynasty, the Tsou people were given court robes and silver plates for their assistance in suppressing a revolt. The festival is held once every two years, either in February or August. An occasion to worship the god of heaven and the war god, it serves to instill tribal solidarity.

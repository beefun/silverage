      <p><font color="#009999" size="3"><strong><em>Atayal Legend of Shooting 
        the Sun</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>In ancient times there were two suns in the sky. Because<br>
        one of them was much bigger than the today's sun, the <br>
        weather was exceedingly hot, the grass and trees were <br>
        withered, the creek water had dried up, and no crops could<br>
        grow. And because the two suns took turns appearing in <br>
        the sky, there was no distinction between day and night, <br>
        and the people led lives of great misery. The people <br>
        discussed this situation among themselves, and decided <br>
        that there was no way they and their children could <br>
        survive unless one of the suns was shot down. At that time<br>
        three warriors declared themselves ready to go shoot a sun<br>
        out of the sky. The warriors took some dried food and <br>
        everyday articles and set out that same day, each one <br>
        carrying young child on his back. <br>
        <br>
        The journey to the sun was very long, and the men planted the seeds of 
        oranges along the way so that they would <br>
        grow into trees by the time they came back. Day followed <br>
        day and year followed year. Before the warriors reached <br>
        the place of the sun, they had already turned into feeble <br>
        old men, and the children who had gone with them had <br>
        grown up. The old men eventually died and their children <br>
        continued on the journey. One day they finally reached <br>
        the place of the sun. There they rested and waited for the <br>
        second sun to come up so that they could shoot it. The <br>
        three men waited at the mouth of a valley as dawn <br>
        approached. As they saw the sun appear, they drew their <br>
        bows and let their arrows fly. <br>
        <br>
        Hit by the arrows, the stricken sun released a stream of <br>
        boiling blood. One of the men was soaked from head to <br>
        feet by the blood and died instantly. The other two were <br>
        scalded, but managed to escape and flee homeward. On <br>
        the journey back they saw that the orange trees their <br>
        fathers had planted were now tall and full of fruit. The two <br>
        were white-haired and stooped-backed old men by the <br>
        time they arrived at their village. But from that time on <br>
        there has been only one sun in the sky, and the night and <br>
        day are clearly distinguished. The moon that we see in the <br>
        nighttime is actually the corpse of the sun that was <br>
        killed.Note: Every living thing has blood, and because the <br>
        sun is living, it therefore also has blood.<br>

        Origins</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>In the distant past a god named Abokirayan lived on the <br>
        sea to the east of Taiwan. One day the god came to the <br>
        island of Botoru, and he settled here with the goddess <br>
        Tariburayan. One day Abokirayan pulled hard on a vine <br>
        hanging from a tree and accidentally kindled a fire. This <br>
        was the beginning of fire. One day when the god and <br>
        goddess were squatting around the fire and cooking yams <br>
        they discovered that the god had a protrusion in the genital<br>
        area and the goddess had an indentation. Later they saw a <br>
        pair of wagtails copulating, and from this they learned <br>
        about sexual intercourse. <br>
        <br>
        Among the couple's numerous descendants, Abokutayan <br>
        made a log boat and sailed with the goddesses <br>
        Tariburayan and Teposuruyan to Kawasan in the west.<br>
        Because a cruel and violent god already occupied Kawasan, the explorers 
        continued to the north until they <br>
        came to Dalaloma (in the vicinity of today's Hualien). <br>
        Since this place was also unsuitable for dwelling, they <br>
        sailed on to the mouth of Liwu creek. The found this to be <br>
        a propitious site for a home, and they planted the sweet <br>
        potatos they had brought with them. They gathered and <br>
        ate the rice and millet that grew wild, used wood and bamboo to make hoes, 
        and tilled the soil. Their <br>
        descendants multiplied and settled along the east coast of <br>
        Taiwan.<br>

        </em></strong></font></p>
      <p>In ancient times the world was ravaged by floods and only<br>
        the peaks of such mountains as Yushan, Mt. Luanta, Mt. <br>
        Chunta, Mt. Shilubiya, and Mt. Chuoshe appeared above <br>
        the waters. Although mankind had found safety on top of <br>
        Yushan, the millet was gone and there was nothing to <br>
        cook with. Fortunately game was abundant, and people <br>
        could kill animals and eat them raw to satisfy their hunger.<br>
        Life was very inconvenient because there was no fire, and <br>
        so everyone looked about for fire. <br>
        <br>
        One day the glow of flames was spotted on Mt. Chuoshe, <br>
        and people immediately sent a bird to bring back some <br>
        fire. However the bird disappeared on the way back. The <br>
        people then sent a long-tailed bird, but the long-tailed bird <br>
        fell into the water and died. Finally the people sent a <br>
        haipiji bird, and this bird at last succeeded at bringing <br>
        back fire. Afterwards there was once a fight between a <br>
        crab and a large snake. The crab pinched open the snake's <br>
        belly, and the snake fled to the west in great pain. The <br>
        places where the snake passed became a river, and all the <br>
        accumulated water flowed away, revealing the land again. <br>
        The people were happy and left the mountains to search <br>
        for good places to live. As a result people scattered in all <br>
        directions and established the tribes and villages that still <br>
        exist today.</p>

      <p>Once upon a time the goddess Panapanayan appeared in the place Nunurao. 
        In her right hand was a stone and in her left a stalk of bamboo. She threw 
        the stone in her right hand down and it became a man. This man founded 
        Malan village after he reached adulthood. Afterwards the goddess planted 
        the bamboo in the ground; the upper segment turned into the goddess Pakosiseru 
        and the lower segment turned into the god Pakomarai. This was the beginning 
        of the Puyuma tribe.</p>

        of Hungtou Village</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>In ancient times people lived by the sea. One day a <br>
        pregnant woman and an old lady went to the seashore <br>
        together to get water. But for some reason the water kept <br>
        receding as the women went forward. The pregnant <br>
        woman first ran and then squatted down to rest. There she <br>
        discovered a white rock, and from beneath the rock came <br>
        a constant stream of water. After the women had moved <br>
        the rock with some difficulty, scooped up water, and <br>
        prepared to return home, the flow of water from under the <br>
        rock increased until it was like a fountain. The water <br>
        flowed after the women and overwhelmed them. <br>
        <br>
        Afterwards the tide continued to rise and swallow the <br>
        village and fields. Finally almost all of the island was <br>
        under the water, and only Wangnan peak and Fangnan <br>
        peak emerged from the waves.Only a few people managed<br>
        to escape to the mountains. Even though these lucky few <br>
        had survived the flood, the pigs, goats, chickens, and mice<br>
        had all drowned, and the mountain had no land on which <br>
        to grow crops. With nothing to eat, the people gradually <br>
        began starving to death. A brother and sister caught lice in <br>
        each other's hair and shared them with the other people. It <br>
        turned out that people who ate the heads of the lice died, <br>
        but those who ate the tails of the lice survived. After four <br>
        years the sea had still not receded, and the only people left<br>
        alive was a husband and wife. The wife was pregnant.In <br>
        the eighth year a large quantity of pebbles and luminous <br>
        shells appeared on the mountain. In the ninth year the <br>
        woman--who had still not given birth--discovered a <br>
        mouse. The woman divided the mouse into two pieces, <br>
        threw one half into the sea, and prayed that the mouse's <br>
        tail would drink up all the sea water and make the land <br>
        reappear. <br>
        <br>
        The woman's prayer was answered and the sea indeed <br>
        gradually retreated, although it took another ten years <br>
        before the sea had gone back to its original position. The <br>
        couple lingered on the mountaintop for another year, and <br>
        only went back down to the flatlands after they had made <br>
        sure there was water to drink. From that time on the <br>
        mountain again became covered with lush forests and <br>
        shrubs.</p>

      <p>In ancient times floods raged and everywhere there was <br>
        water. At that time a brother and sister were able to save <br>
        themselves from drowning by grasping a clump of <br>
        &quot;Lagegerih&quot; grass. But since they couldn't find any dry <br>
        land or place to live, they faced each other and cried. <br>
        Suddenly an earthworm appeared and the earthworm's <br>
        excrement became a mountain ridge sticking out of the <br>
        water. The brother and sister lived on these mountains for <br>
        a period of time, but life was difficult because they had no <br>
        fire. Unexpectedly a beetle flew down from the sky one <br>
        day. In the beetle's mouth was a burning piece of cord, <br>
        and the brother and sister took it and used it to make fire. <br>
        <br>
        From that time fire has burned continuously and has never <br>
        been extinguished. The brother and sister farmed the land <br>
        created by the earthworm after they had reached <br>
        adulthood. Everywhere they found the seeds of yams, <br>
        taro, and millet, and they reaped a rich harvest by planting <br>
        these seeds. The years passed, but the brother and sister <br>
        couldn't find anyone to be their spouses. Eventually they <br>
        gave up and decided to marry each other. Although in the <br>
        beginning all their children were deformed--some were <br>
        blind and some lacked limbs--the second were more <br>
        normal, and the third generation were all healthy and <br>
        normal. It is thus said that deformed children are the bad <br>
        result of marriage between brothers and sisters. A unique <br>
        feature of Paiwan legends is they can be sung.<br>

      <p><font color="#009999" size="3"><strong><em>Rukai Legend of the Founding 
        of Villages</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>It is said that the founder of Haocha village--Puraruyan--<br>
        was a very strong and brave warrior. About 600 or 700 <br>
        years ago in a place called Shichiparichi--located on <br>
        Rarando mountain between Taimali and Chihpen in what <br>
        today is Taitung county--Puraruyan and a cloud leopard <br>
        followed Taimali creek into the mountains. There he went <br>
        hunting on Mt. Wutou and Mt. Peitawu. Because his <br>
        leopard didn't want to leave the place of Karusgan in the <br>
        Tataudaiwan part of the Haocha area, Puraruyan <br>
        discovered the scenic beauty of Haocha.Therefore <br>
        Puraruyan later led a band of his kin and tribesmen back <br>
        to Haocha to settle and build their homes. <br>
        <br>
        Puraruyan continued west across high peaks and came to <br>
        Manakual and the Lumingan plateau. Some of Puraruyan's<br>
        moved to the latter place. Four or five households--<br>
        roughly 40 people--settled at Haocha. Because <br>
        Puraruyan's leopard had previously changed into a person <br>
        at Kalesngan, the people commemorated this transformation by building 
        a house at the spot.Later <br>
        Puraruyan's descendants built a house at Katsyanlan and <br>
        called the place Kazangilan. This house was made into an <br>
        ancestral shrine and used exclusively for sacrifices.<br>

      <p><font color="#009999" size="3"><strong><em>Tsou &amp; Thao Legend of 
        the Origin of Headhunting</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>During the time of the flood the Tsou lived by hunting <br>
        wild animals. After killing and eating a dog one day, the <br>
        people placed its head on top of a bamboo pole. The stuck<br>
        the pole in the ground and left it as a source of <br>
        amusement. Next someone killed a monkey, and everyone<br>
        thought it entertaining when its head was also put on a <br>
        pole. Afterwards everyone thought how it would be even <br>
        better if they killed a person and put the person's head on <br>
        a pole. When a naughty boy happened to pass by, the <br>
        people killed him, cut off his head, and stuck it on a high <br>
        pole. Everyone thought this was great fun. All the different<br>
        tribes dispersed after the floodwaters had receded. <br>
        <br>
        The tribes became more and more estranged from each other as time went 
        by, and they killed each other and took heads for sport. This is the origin 
        of the custom of headhunting. It is said that the Tsou originally consisted 
        of a single clan. After the custom of headhunting had taken root, a rule 
        was laid down: A new clan could be established whenever an enemy head 
        was taken in war, and the name of the dead person would be the name of 
        the clan. From that time on the number of Tsou clans gradually increased.

        of the Dwarf Spirit Ceremony</em></strong></font></p>
      <p>It is said that the Saisiyat formerly lived together with the<br>
        Pasdai dwarves. The Pasdai showed the Saisiyat how to <br>
        farm, gave them seeds, and taught them rites, ceremonies, <br>
        songs, and dances. Therefore the Saisiyat considered the <br>
        Pasdai to be their benefactors, and invited them to come <br>
        drink beer and make merry whenever there happened to <br>
        be a festival or celebration. But once on the night of the <br>
        harvest festival a dwarf took liberties with a Saisiyat girl, <br>
        and her tribesmen decided to take revenge. They cut in <br>
        half the trunk of the mountain loquat tree that served as a <br>
        bridge to the village of the dwarves. <br>
        <br>
        All the dwarves on the bridge fell into the water and died, <br>
        and only two managed to escape. These two dwarves <br>
        composed a song containing their exhortations to the <br>
        Saisiyat. They gave this song to the Saisiyat in hopes that <br>
        the latter would remember their admonishments and hold <br>
        regular ceremonies in honor of the dwarves. As the two <br>
        dwarves departed to the east along the river, they pulled <br>
        the leaves off palm trees and warned the Saisiyat that their <br>
        crops would wither and their tribe become extinct if they <br>
        did not heed the dwarves' words. In hope that the dwarves <br>
        will protect them and their crops, the Saisiyat hold a dwarf <br>
        spirit ceremony every year to console the spirits of the <br>
        dwarves and pray for their blessings. </p>

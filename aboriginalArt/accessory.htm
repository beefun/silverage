              cloth The women commonly wore sleeveless robes over their homespun 
              hemp garments. One type of robe was as long as an overcoat and extended 
              down to the knees, while another extended to the abdomen. These 
              robes were made from two pieces of cloth sewed together, one piece 
              becoming the back and the other becoming the front. Two belts with 
              buttons were fastened to the breast. Their finery consisted of a 
              piece of white cloth decorated on the front and the back with geometric 
              patterns. <br>
              <br>
              One of the most significant features of the Atayal tribe is their 
              use of beaded clothing in which is sewn beads and shells. They wrapped 
              a length of striped cloth horizontally around their waist to serve 
              as a short skirt, and hung an oblique square piece of cloth from 
              their chest to serve as a chest wrapper. </p>
            <p>In the winter and fall all members of the tribe wrapped a long 
              robe sewn from four pieces of cloth around their bodies, somewhat 
              like the Kasyapa robe worn by a Buddhist monk. This robe was fastened 
              at the left shoulder as a cape, and on the head was worn a semicircular 
              wicker cap. </p>
            <p>The Atayal wear long garments adorned with bells during their ceremonies. 
              The copper bells strike each other when the participants are dancing, 
              producing a rhythmic musical sound and adding to the festive atmosphere.

            <p>Clothing was a secondary form of consumption for the Amis, and 
              usually was not considered to be very important. Clothing was worn 
              mostly to provide warmth, and--primarily for the men--as a means 
              of displaying age and status during festivals.</p>
            <p>Clothing among the Amis could be divided into everyday and ceremonial 
              attire. As far as their everyday dress was concerned, in winter 
              the men wore a leather shirt, a hemp jacket, and a loincloth; in 
              summer the upper part of the body was left bare and a loincloth 
              worn for modesty. Women's dress consisted of a short upper garment 
              with long sleeves, an upper garment with short sleeves, and an apron. 
              In summer the women wore only a skirt and bared the upper part of 
              their body.</p>
            <p>The ceremonial dress of the Amis men included a feathered headdress, 
              leggings, and a long jacket. The women wore a beaded hat, a skirt, 
              and an upper garment with sleeves. Both men and women wore a very 
              colorful betel nut pouch.</p>

<p>What clothing was worn by a member of the Puyuma tribe was determined 
              by whether they were a man or a woman, young or old, high or low 
              status. For example, the men wear short skirts and the women wear 
              women's skirts. The most colorful clothing is worn by men and women 
              who are eligible for marriage.</p>
            <p>Among the men, the young men's clothing was most beautiful. The 
              upper garment consisted of a black shirt with long sleeves, a short 
              front, and five buttons. The cuffs and the front of the crotch on 
              the black short pants were decorated with embroidered hems. Pants 
              were worn by members of the chief's family and were embroidered 
              on the front on the legs with red, yellow, and black thread. The 
              men wore betel nut bags decorated with embroidery or decorations 
              in the form of ears of grain, and purses that were fastened to their 
              waist with multi-colored striped ribbons. The finery of the chief 
              and medicine men included feathered headdresses, headbands, and 
              shoulder bands; however most tribesmen only wore a short black skirt 
              and a kerchief around their head.</p>
            <p>Among the women, the most complete set of clothing was worn by 
              the young women who were eligible for marriage. Garments included 
              a square printed kerchief that was folded into a triangle and wrapped 
              around the women's heads. The upper garment was similar to that 
              worn by the men, but the hem was decorated with a wavy strip of 
              white cloth. A back wrap was embroidered around the borders, had 
              a pocket in a double layer, and was worn wrapped around the back 
              and hanging over the buttocks. A short skirt was made of a rectangular 
              piece of black cloth, had cords of white or red cloth, was decorated 
              with a wavy hem and was sometimes embroidered. Leggings worn on 
              the calves consisted of square pieces of cloth with cords attached 
              to the four corners. Although black was most common, sometimes the 
              leggings were made of printed blue fabric.</p>

              stitched into the lower parts of the back and front. </p>
            <p>Another type of garment was a long robe with sleeves. The vests 
              worn by both men and women were stitched from two pieces of folded 
              cloth and had decorative pieces of cloth sewn on to the front and 
              back. The upper garments worn by both men and women had diamond-shaped 
              pieces of cloth sewn on as decoration. The belt wrapped around the 
              upper garment and two pieces of hemp cloth were stitched together 
              to form a cape. The men and women both wore a short black cotton 
              skirt. The men wore a T-shaped belt, and the women wore dark-hued 
              cotton leggings. The bottom hems were frequently ornamented with 
              small bells and such leggings were worn at festivals.</p>

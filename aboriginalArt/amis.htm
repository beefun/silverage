around Mt. Chi-lai in North Hua-lian, the long 
and narrow seacoast plains and the hilly lands

on the matrilineal clans. After a woman marrying 
her husband, they live together in her residence. 
The family affairs and finance of the family are 
all decided by the female householder, except that 
some important affairs such as marriage or the 
allocation of wealth, the public affairs as the 
tribal politics, the law, the wars, and the religions 
are dealt with by an institution consisting of males 
of age grades.

meaning of a male member entering a new age grades.<br><br>

Harvest Ceremony: It is held every year in July or August. Apart from its agricultural meaning, it is also the most important social event of a year, and it is full of the cheerful songs and graceful dances that are characteristic of the Amis.

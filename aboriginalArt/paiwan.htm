    <td>Along the Jungyang Mountains, the area from north 
Dawn Shan mountain to Hengchuen, west to Fangliau , 
east to Ta Ma Li, across the ridge of the Jungyang 
Mountains . The population is about seventy thousand. 

The residence of the noble chief in every tribe 
is the center of the tribal politics, the military, 
and even the religion; thus it becomes independent 
and autonomous unit. As this ethnic group has a large 
population and the blood relationship is wide spread, 
the alliance between close relatives is prevailing 
among the nobles. 

As a result, cases are that in some areas, only few 
nobles lead many tribes and there is trans-tribal 
allegiance among them. As for the material culture, 
there are colored glaze balls, the iron utensils, 
and silvery. 

The spirit of this tribe is shown by the hundred 
pace snake and human-headed designs, which symbolizes 
the transcendent status of the nobles, carved on 
the roof beams and the pots.

Maleveq (five-year rite): This "Bamboo Festival" is held once every five years. In it they observe a unique custom of using bamboo rods to stab at rattan balls in the hope of attaining good fortune. The long bamboo poles represent the prayers of the people wishing for safe farming and hunting and good weather. This ceremony also serves to assuage the spirits of the members of the tribe who have drowned.

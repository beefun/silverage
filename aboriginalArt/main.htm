Aboriginal people of Taiwan were the first settlers 
of Taiwan, andtraces of their early settlements can 
be found on mountainsides ornext to bodies of water. 
Each tribe has its own unique culture.  Mysterious 
legends, beautiful songs and dances, and unique rites 
are part of the dignified and sacred traditional festivals 
of Taiwan's aboriginal peoples. Apart from passing 
down tribal cultural legacies and providing a sense 
of tribal community, these festivals also encourage 
the young people of the tribes, helping to bolster 
their confidence and giving them new understanding 
about their own culture.<br>

          <pre><br><br>The aborigines of Taiwan speak languages belonging to <br>the Austronesian language family. The Austronesian 
languages are among the most widely distributed of 
the world's language families: The area inhabited 
by Austronesian peoples extends from Madagascar 
in the west to Easter Island in the east; and from 
Taiwan in the north to New Zealand in the south. 
Austronesian speakers on Taiwan can be roughly 
divided into the "aboriginal" tribes and the "Pingpu" 
tribes. Although the "aboriginal" tribes still preserve 
their languages, customs, and village social structure, 
they are now facing the impact of rapid modernization. 
The great majority of the Pingpu tribes have already 
lost their languages and customs.

There are currently two major theories concerning the 
origin of the Taiwanese aborigines. While the first 
theory proposes that the aborigines originated in 
some other area, the second asserts that Taiwan is 
the ancestral homeland of the Austronesian peoples. 

The first theory has found widespread acceptance, and 
its claim that the Austronesian peoples arose on the 
southeast coast of mainland China has support from 
linguistic, archeological, historical, and mythological 
evidence. 

Some scholars have even proposed a chronology for the arrival 
of the aboriginal tribes in Taiwan; for example, the Saisiat 
and Taiya tribes are thought to have arrived in Taiwan during 
the early ceramic period around. 3,000 B.C., whereas the Paiwan 
and Beinan tribes probably arrived during the heyday of 
the Megalithic culture of Southeast Asia. On the other hand, 
the theory that Taiwan was the cradle of the Austronesian 
languages is relatively new, and has found support from many 
linguists. Further research will be needed to determine which 
of these theories is correct.

    <td>They live in the south valley of Tai Dong. When it was 
prosperous, it dominated 72 groups. At present, 
the population is about ten thousand; the whole ethnic 
group can be divided into eight sub-tribes. Thus it is 
also called Pa-Sher-Fan ("Fan" is a discriminating).

These groups have different origins. Some are called 
"born from bamboo". These belong to the Beinan group. 
The others are called "born from stone" and they 
belong to the Jrben group. <br><br>

The main traditional social organization is maintained 
by two systems: 
one is the family system charged and inherited by the 
eldest daughter, and the other is the institutions for 
males of age sets and stay in a hall, so as to build them 
strong bodies to protect their tribe. Before men get 
married they will stay in their assembly hall and be part 
of a military group. These groups will be divided 
according to their ages and they are trained to defend 
their tribe.  <br><br>

Harvest Ceremony: Millet is the Puyuma's main crop. The tribal shaman conducts the ceremony as they put the harvested millet into storehouses.

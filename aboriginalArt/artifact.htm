        <br>
        Among all the tribes, the Atayal were most skilled at weaving hemp cloth. 
        The fibers were twisted between the fingers, and no spinning wheel was 
        used. Like the other tribes, the Taiya also used a seated backstrap loom. 
        Weaving was considered women's work among the Atayal, and the quality 
        of a woman's weaving determined her social status. The Atayal's skill 
        at weaving hemp cloth was developed to a very high degree. Women in other 
        tribes were also quite good at weaving.<br>

              Paiwan wood carving was very highly developed.Although wood carving 
              was done for ornamental purposes the tribes of northern and central

              low. </p>
            <p>In nature, the wood carvings produced by the tribes of southern 
              Taiwan were either symbolic or realistic. Carving techniques included 
              relief, intaglio, three-dimensional carving, and through-cut carving. 
              A very wide range of objects were carved. Among the Paiwan, apart 
              from toys and purely ornamental objects, buildings, furniture, tools, 
              weapons, and religious implements were also decorated with carvings. 
              The most common subjects of carvings among the Paiwan were human 
              heads and pairs of snakes, followed by naked human beings, animal 
              and snake designs, and water caltrop-shaped designs.</p>
